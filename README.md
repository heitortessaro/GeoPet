# GeoPet
GeoPet is a service to geolocalize your pet. This project is part of the .NET acceleration resulting from a partnership between Trybe and Wiz.

This project develops the first portion of the GeoPet service, focusing on the Back-End application. It uses some external services, such as the *Nominatin API*. The architecture of the complete project, considering future phases, is present below:

The GeoPet Back-End provides two main C.R.U.D routes. The first one is intended for the administrators to manage the pet caretakers' data. With the second one, the administrators should be capable of managing the pet information. The GeoPet service also allows the user to receive a QR code with all information related to their pet.

## Running the project on your machine

## Postman collection

To test the service, we prepared a Postman collection. Using the following button, you will be redirected to a Postman page, where you can choose between forking the collection, viewing the collection in a public workspace, or importing a copy of the collection. 

**add button here**

We recommend you fork the collection using the button presented on the screen. Thus, you can change the collection and add your personal information to the local environment.

After clicking on Fork Collection, you will be redirected to a Postman page where you can define the forked collection label and select the workspace to save the forked collection and environment.
